      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> month(s)
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
      my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog.
